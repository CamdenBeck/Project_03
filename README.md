# Project_03
## Description

This project is a web application designed to analyze data from airlines from 1993 to 2020 and display the results on a webpage. It provides insights into airline flights, number of passengers, and other metrics.

## Features

- Data retrieval from airline data sources
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Data visualization using D3.js
- Interactive charts and graphs for data analysis
- User-friendly interface for exploring data insights

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CamdenBeck/Project_03.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Project_03
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the data ETL notebook to load the data:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook ETL.ipynb
     ```
2. Run the data analysis notebook to see the insights in the data:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb
    ```
3. The correct ".json" data files will then appear, and you can run the index.html file to start the server.

### Ethical Considerations

In developing this project, we have taken several steps to ensure ethical considerations are addressed. The data used in this project is sourced from publicly available datasets, ensuring that all information is in the public domain and complies with data privacy regulations.

## Data Analysis

This project includes a data analysis component that processes airline data to extract meaningful insights. The analysis results are displayed on the web application to provide users with valuable information about airline flights, number of passengers, and other metrics.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- JupyterNotebooks for data cleaning and further visualizations
- HTML for webpage structure
- JavaScript for web-application
- MongoDB for the database
- D3.js for data extraction in the web-application
- Plotly for visualization in the web browser

## Data Sources

The data used in this project is sourced from publicly available airline datasets, including:

- Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)
